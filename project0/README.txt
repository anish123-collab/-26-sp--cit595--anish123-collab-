This course will help me strengthn my understanding of system-level programing by focusing on how software interacts with the operating system, memory and devlopment tools. I hope to deepen my understanding of buidling, writing and debugging C program while continueing to work with debugging tools and developing a disciplined approach to writing and debugging C code. Setting up the Git resportigy reinforced the importance or version control and clear project organization when working in collaborative or graded enviroment. Configuring Docker was definately a challenge as I have never worked with the terminal within MacOS before but was an intresting process as well. Confuring and using Docking highlighed how I can build an environment to ensure conisitent buildf and runtime enviroments across machines with diffrent hardware capacities. This will help to reduce setup issues and navigate through hardware limiations across platforms.
